# letter-generator

This file is meant to be a letter generator,
aimed at direct letter campaigns. This is an effort made
since I am looking to do Real Estate direct mailing campaigns, 
and do not want to write all the letters.

This script will use a text file that has my templated letter.
The script has symbols that are placed ins pecific parts, which will
be replaced by the information that is received from the excel sheet.

It will accept an excel sheet, but the sheet needs columns:

First name | Last Name | Owner 2 First Name | Property Address
